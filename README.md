# MandelbrotSharp
Is a highly extensible fractal rendering library that combines high speed generic arithmetic with a flexible framework that will get your M-Type fractal rendering project off the ground in a jiffy.  
This repository includes the main library code (found in /MandelbrotSharp) and an example application (found in /Mandelbrot) that demonstrates two simple use cases for the library.  
TO-DO: add guide to source code and classes
